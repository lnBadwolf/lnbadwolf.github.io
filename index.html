      Installed Atom and had to figure out how to install packages and use it.
      I'm new to linux so its a learning experance but seems to be working good
      now. Site updates include a little bit of formatting, cleaning up the code
      and adding some more links on the Bitcoin page.

    <p>Finished the HTML course from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp.org</a> I already knew a lot of this, but it was nice
     to sit down and complete a thing.

  I now appear to have the page as a proper html file. I Haven't fully flesh out this project but I suppose it would be a
  good place to dump resources as i find them.

  I'm currantly learning Html via  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>
 just going through the first lesson on codeing. I've done some HTML
  before and want to learn another lanuage, maybe Python, I don't know.
But brushing up on HTML and getting a better understanding of how it
actually works
  aside from just copying code from somewhere else seems like a good
idea.
