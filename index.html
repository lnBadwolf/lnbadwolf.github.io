 <p>I now appear to have the page as a proper html file. I Haven't fully flesh out this project but I suppose it would be a 
  good place to dump resources as i find them.

  I'm currantly learning Html via  <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a> just going through the first lesson on codeing. I've done some HTML 
  before and want to learn another lanuage, maybe Python, I don't know. But brushing up on HTML and getting a better understanding of how it actually works
  aside from just copying code from somewhere else seems like a good idea.
